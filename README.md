# Simple-Notes

This frontend is built using `SvelteKit` and `Tailwind CSS`. It fetches user data from a `PostgreSQL` database backend that is connected to our frontend via our [GO RESTful API](https://github.com/HamidRezaKhoram/simple-note-backend).

## Developers

This SvelteKit app was developed by [Hamidreza Khoramrokh](https://github.com/HamidRezaKhoram/) and [Daniel Ibanescu](https://github.com/zazu7765).
